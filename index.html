<p>In the next 10 years I would like to see myself in an amazing company like google or microsoft.
 The process to get there though will be rigorous. In highschool, I will  graduate with top 10 in my class, go to a great college, preferably in UT Austin where I’ll be majoring in computer science.
 I wouldn’t really need college because to be a web developer you really only need certifications and experience.
 I would probably go to college for the college experience and some refining on my programming skills.</p>
