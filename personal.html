<p>I would probably still live in Texas, most likely in Houston or austin somewhere. If I’m 26, I don’t think I will have children in the future, I might have a wife or in a place where I’m looking for one. If I do have kids early on I will have to plan on it. I would like to have a decent car that isn’t too flashy and can get me to point A to point B efficiently. I would probably keep my physique by working out and going to the gym about 3 to 4 times a week. </p>
